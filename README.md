## My First Formula!  

I was just 17 years old when I created and proved this formula!  
This formula is unique—you won’t find it anywhere else!  
(*And yes, I can prove it!*)

## About the Formula  

This formula is used to determine if a number between  
[ $P_n$# - $P_{n+1}^2$ ,
 $P_n$# + $P_{n+1}^2$ ]  

is **not a prime number**.  

- **How it works**:  
  - If the formula indicates that the number is not prime, then it is definitely **not a prime**.  
  - However, if the result suggests it is prime, there’s no absolute certainty—it is **probably a prime**, but further verification is needed.  

This method provides a highly efficient way to narrow down candidates for primality testing, making it a valuable tool for analyzing large numbers.
